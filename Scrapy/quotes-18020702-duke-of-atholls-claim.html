        On the order of the day for the third reading of the Athol Compensation bill,

        Mr. <span class="italic">Creevey</span>, made his protest against the bill, which he unequivocally condemned.
      </p>
      
      <p class='procedural'>

        Earl <span class="italic">Temple</span> expressed his strong conviction that the passing of this bill deserved the epithet that had been applied to it, "of a scandalous job." No measure of this kind had ever been carried before without recommendation from the crown. That, or an address, ought always to precede the granting of a pension to that amount from the consolidated fund.
      </p>

        Colonel <span class="italic">Stanley</span> assured the house, that had he considered this measure as a job, he would have had nothing to do with it. On the contrary, he thought it a measure of justice.
      </p>

        Mr. <span class="italic">S<span class="obscured">[...]</span>heridan</span> had waited to hear a few more protesters; but he thought the gentlemen might protest in less strong terms. Their strength of language, however, might be intended to cover their weakness of argument. He should not follow their example, and call them a scandalous opposition. As the summer season was come on, they would have time in the adjournment to become better informed of the nature of the business; and he believed they would then rejoice that their opposition had failed, as much as he now did.
      </p>

        Mr. <span class="italic">Calcraft</span> thought the hon. gentleman himself had paid little attention to the subject, since he constantly argued from some private statement, and not from the parliamentary documents.
      </p>
      
      <p class='procedural'>
        <a class='permalink' href='duke-of-atholls-claim#S1V0005P0_18020702_HOC_11' title='Link to this contribution' rel='bookmark'>&sect;</a>
        Mr. <span class="italic">Wilberforce</span> confirmed what had been stated by the last speaker, respecting Mr. Sheridan's reference to a private statement, which he called The Case of the Duke of Athol. The revenues, according to the profit of which the noble duke was to receive an annuity, were the consequence of acts of parliament passed since the transfer, and to which he had no claim.
      </p>
      
      <p class='procedural'>
        <a class='permalink' href='duke-of-atholls-claim#S1V0005P0_18020702_HOC_12' title='Link to this contribution' rel='bookmark'>&sect;</a>
        Lord <span class="italic">De Blaquiere</span> spoke warmly in behalf of the claim; he never gave a more conscientious vote in his life, than he should do for this measure.&#x2014;A division then took place, when the numbers were, for the third reading, 42; against it, 12; majority 30.
      </p>
      
      <p class='procedural'>
        <a class='permalink' href='duke-of-atholls-claim#S1V0005P0_18020702_HOC_13' title='Link to this contribution' rel='bookmark'>&sect;</a>
        Mr. <span class="italic">Fobustone</span> proposed, that the annuity should commence at the death of the duchess dowager of Athol, which proposition was rejected without a division&#x2014; Adjourned.
